# How it's work ?
 Just clone this repo and npm i in it , 
 add your google map api key, 
 test it directly in the browser console and do :
  const test = document.createElement('test-resolve-button');
  document.body.appendChild(test)
 And just click on it and see magic happen


# I'm currently workin on it, it doesn't work well.
